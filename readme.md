# Joystick Gremlin - Diagrams

## What is this tool for?

The default built in export functionality in Joystick Gremlin is quite basic, and not particularly helpful as you just seen "button 1" and so forth. This tool will allow you to

- Export your buttons to a PDF
- Overlay your buttons onto an actual Joystick profile/picture


## What's supported?

- Custom SVG templates can be built to suit your joystick
- Support for multiple profiles in Joystick Gremlin



## What's not supported

- Importing of base templates into button profile exports (TBC)
