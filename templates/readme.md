# Templates

Define templates in SVG. Name of template should match your Joystick Gremlin device name.

If you have created a template, happy to include it back in the repository (might make some edits to standardise it)

- Open Template.SVG in Draw.io to see what it does and use as a basis
- Rename Template.SVG to Your-Device-Name.svg and see how it works

# Default Templates

- Virpil T50-CM2 Stick
- Virpil T50-CM2 Throttle
